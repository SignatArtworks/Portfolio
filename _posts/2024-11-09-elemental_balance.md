This powerful painting juxtaposes vivid red and deep blue in a dramatic encounter of color and movement. The intense red swirls like molten lava, while the cool blue flows below, reminiscent of the depths of an ocean wave. A sharp line of black separates the two, capturing the tension and harmony between fire and water, heat and coolness, energy and calm.

"Elemental Balance" invites viewers to feel the dynamic tension of opposites, a visual exploration of contrasting forces that coexist in equilibrium. This piece brings a bold, energising presence to any space, ideal for those drawn to art that celebrates the beauty of duality and the interplay of natureâ€™s most powerful elements.
