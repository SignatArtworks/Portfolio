This piece carries the weight of a journey through darkness into light. It began in muted tones, created during a challenging period, and over time, layers of vibrant color were added, breathing life and energy into its form. The swirling lines and bold contrasts hint at the heart's resilienceâ€”a quiet strength that endures and transforms.
"Reconstructed Heart" invites the viewer to find their own meaning within its curves and colors, a reminder of renewal and the beauty that emerges from life's shadows. A striking piece for those who appreciate art that speaks to strength and hope.
